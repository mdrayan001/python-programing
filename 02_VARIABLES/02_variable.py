# In python , variables are used to store data values.
# Variables are created when you assign a value to them.
# Variable names can be any length and can include letters, numbers, and underscores.
# However, they cannot start with a number and should not use reserved keywords.
# Variable names are case-sensitive, meaning that 'name' and 'Name' would be considered different variables.
# A variable is created the moment you assign a value to it usig the assignment operator (=).


name = "md rayan"  # here name is a variable  (integer)
age = 20  # here age is a variable   (string)
cgpa = 3.75  # here cgpa is a variable (float)

print(name)
print(type(name))  # this will print the type of variable name
print
